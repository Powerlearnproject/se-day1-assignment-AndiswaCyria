Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is a process of designing, creating or building, and testing as well as the maintenance of software applications.It uses enineering principles as well as programming softwares to create applications that are user friendly, safe and stable and reliable to the user experience. It is important in the technology industry as it fosters a foundation for creating reliable, efficient and scalable software that helps businesses optimize operations and productivity, create and roll out smooth processes, manage their data in an effective manner, and gain a competitive edge accross sectors through tailored applications.  

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

 The software crisis of the 1960s and 1970s: A turning point where the conmplexitities of software systems prevailed and developments projects were affected by delays, cost overruns and unreliable software. This is where a need for reliable and a discipline approach to manage software emerged as structured programme to solve the software crisis as it has clear and modular code structures, reducing complexity and improving maintainability. 
 The advent of object-oriented programme: The paradigm revolutionairised software development through allowing developers to recreate real world entities as objects, promoting code reusability, modularity, and easier maintenance through concepts like inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism. The ideas had been emerging since the 1960s with the development of languages like Simula and Smalltalk which brought OOP to the mainstream.
 Structured programme methodologies: This marked a shift towards modular and organized code design with concepts like top-down design and structured control flow, enabling better code readability and maintainability. 

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.



Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
